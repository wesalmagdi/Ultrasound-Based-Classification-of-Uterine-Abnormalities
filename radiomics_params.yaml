#GLCM: Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix
# This method analyzes the spatial relationship of pixels by
# counting how often a pixel with a specific gray-level value occurs in a particular spatial relationship
# (at a given distance and angle) to another pixel with a different specific gray-level value. It provides insight
# into the local homogeneity, contrast, and correlation of the image texture.
# GLRLM: Gray-Level Run Length Matrix
# The GLRLM quantifies consecutive pixels of the same gray-level intensity
# in a given direction. A "run" is defined as a sequence of adjacent pixels with the same value.
# This matrix helps analyze texture characteristics related to run lengths
#  (e.g., short or long runs) and gray-level non-uniformity.
# GLSZM: Gray-Level Size Zone Matrix
# Similar to GLRLM but without considering directionality, the GLSZM quantifies
# connected regions ("zones") of pixels with the same gray-level intensity and their size.
# It provides information about the size and uniformity of these homogeneous zones within the image.
# GLDM: Gray-Level Dependence Matrix
# The GLDM measures local gray-level dependencies within a specified distance.
# It counts the number of connected voxels that are "dependent" on a center voxel,
#  where dependency is often defined by a threshold of absolute difference in gray levels.
# NGTDM: Neighboring Gray Tone Difference Matrix
# This matrix evaluates the difference between the gray-level intensity of a center pixel
# and the average gray-level intensity of its neighborhood within a given distance.
#  It helps quantify texture properties like "busyness" or coarseness,
#  which relate to the degree of difference between a pixel and its surroundings
